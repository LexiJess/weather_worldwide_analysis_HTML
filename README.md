I used a set of data and visualizations from a previous project (https://github.com/LexiJess/python-api-challenge) in this project, too. 

The analyses are pretty straightforward--the visualizations speak for themselves. The largest difference in this project is the data page of this website. It shows all the data that went into making the visualizations and analyses. It's iteresting to see the data in a dynamic table, if only because it shows how large and cumbersome looking at big data sets is without data wrangling tools.
